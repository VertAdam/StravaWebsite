# StravaWebsite
Hello! 

This is the code I used for my blog post [*Connecting and Mapping Strava Data with Python and Django*](https://betterprogramming.pub/connecting-and-mapping-strava-data-with-python-and-django-41456b874f3b). I created the 
tutorial since as I was making my own project connecting Django with the Strava API, I found that there was no good 
resource to refer to. So, after figuring out everything myself I figured it may be useful to someone if I share the 
what I found.
